# Project Eden

This is just me toying around with some ideas for an open-world sandbox game,
primarily as a way to leverage my daughter's Minecraft obsession into something
more productive.

It contains a simple server, a slightly-working browser client, and not-working-at-all
Go and C++ clients.

Don't build this and expect it to do very much yet. When there's something actually
worth playing with, I'll update the README to reflect that.
